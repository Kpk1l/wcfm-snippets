BUGS

WEBP Support for WCFM Frontend 
 - Currently many plugins on the market will insert <picture> - this breaks WCFM.
 
Analytics
 - Stats track every view (even refreshes). WCFM have plans to revamp the Analytics.
 
Product limit cap
 - When you set a product limit, eg. 15, and the vendor has 14 products and 1 set as draft (15 total). They are unable to submit the last 15th product.
 - Temp fix: https://github.com/davidpottrell/wcfm-snippets/blob/main/last-product-limit-overwrite
